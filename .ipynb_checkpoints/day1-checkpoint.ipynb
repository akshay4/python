    "If you already have some Python experience, I hope I can teach you at least a few new tricks, or throw you a few challenging problems.\n",

Good news: we have [several tracks on Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) for just that purpose. The goal of this challenge is to quickly cover the fundamentals of the language - which will hopefully stand you in good stead whether you use Python for deep learning, data cleaning, or cheating at Scrabble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each day of the Python Challenge will consist of two parts:\n",
    "- A **tutorial** notebook explaining Python concepts and showing example code. That's where you are now.\n",
    "- An [**exercise**](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/969424) notebook with questions and coding problems to test your new knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's tutorial includes a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic operators. If you have previous Python experience, day 1 might not hold anything new for you, so feel free to [skip straight to the exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/969424).\n",
